# Git Learning System: Project Context

## 1. Project Overview

The Git Learning System is an AI-driven educational platform designed to teach Git version control through a combination of modern educational methodologies and robust technical architecture. The system aims to provide personalized, adaptive learning experiences for users at different skill levels.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Architecture (Three-Layer Design)

#### Adaptive AI Engine (Decision Layer)
- Learning path generation and adaptation
- Skill assessment and progression tracking
- Content difficulty adjustment
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Misconception detection

#### Educational Content Manager (Logic Layer)
- Exercise management and generation
- Command validation and verification
- Progress tracking and persistence
- Learning analytics processing
- Content delivery orchestration

#### Interactive CLI Interface (Presentation Layer)
- Command-line interface for user interaction
- Real-time feedback presentation
- Progress visualization
- Virtual file system simulation
- Context-sensitive help system

### 2.2 Educational Framework

The system integrates multiple proven teaching methodologies:
- **Socratic Method**: Question-based learning to guide discovery
- **Project-Based Learning**: Real-world scenarios that mirror actual Git usage
- **Spaced Repetition**: Algorithm-driven review scheduling for retention
- **Mastery Learning**: Clear progression paths with competency requirements
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Dynamic challenge scaling based on performance

### 2.3 Learning Pipeline (4-Stage Process)

1. **Assessment**: Initial evaluation of user knowledge and skills
2. **Guided Practice**: Structured exercises with adaptive difficulty
3. **Real Project**: Application of skills in authentic scenarios
4. **Retention Review**: Scheduled reinforcement of learned concepts

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Heroku
- **Documentation**: Sphinx

### 3.2 Key Technical Requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Persistent data storage for user progress
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- PEP 8 compliant code with proper type hinting
- Extensive test coverage (unit, integration, system)
- Security features to prevent cheating and ensure learning integrity

## 4. Exercise Framework

### 4.1 Difficulty Tiers
- **Beginner**: Basic Git operations (init, add, commit)
- **Intermediate**: Branching, merging, remote operations
- **Advanced**: Complex workflows, rebasing, conflict resolution, hooks

### 4.2 Exercise Types
- Command validation exercises
