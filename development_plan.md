2. Test against multiple Git versions and document compatibility
3. Optimize for performance and consider paid tier for production
4. Comprehensive testing and user feedback collection

## Conclusion

For every implementation of a feature found in the plan, update the plan to markk that feature as complete.
When the entire project is substantially modified, it will be pushed to github so we can track changes and see how the project has evolved over time.
