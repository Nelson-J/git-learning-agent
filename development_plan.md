2. Test against multiple Git versions and document compatibility
3. Optimize for performance and consider paid tier for production
4. Comprehensive testing and user feedback collection

## Conclusion

For every implementation of a feature found in the plan, update the plan to markk that feature as complete.
When the entire project is substantially modified, it will be pushed to github so we can track changes and see how the project has evolved over time.
Start each development phase by reviewing the relevant sections of the context file
Use the development plan to guide regular development activities

Maintain optimal folder structure for this project
During development, tests should be built following a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and maintainability.
