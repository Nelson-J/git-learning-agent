## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Technical Complexity**: AI components may require more resources than expected
2. **Git Version Compatibility**: Different Git versions may behave differently
3. **Performance on Local Machine**: Free tier limitations may impact user experience
4. **Exercise Validation**: Edge cases in Git behavior may be difficult to validate

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Start with simpler algorithms and iteratively improve
2. Test against multiple Git versions and document compatibility
3. Optimize for performance and consider paid tier for production
4. Comprehensive testing and user feedback collection

## Conclusion

For every implementation of a feature found in the plan, update the plan to mark that feature as complete. The project code should be written according to the defined linters and style guides and best practices.
When the entire project is substantially modified, it will be pushed to github so we can track changes and see how the project has evolved over time.
Start each development phase by reviewing the relevant sections of the context file
Use the development plan to guide regular development activities

Integrate the using linters in the development plan into the project's workflow
Maintain optimal folder structure for this project
During development, tests should be built following a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and maintainability.
